# LinqLearn

A small application that performs basic LINQ operations on a list. This list contains an Id, first name, last name, age and location. At runtime, the list of 100 people is randomly generated. Choose any LINQ option to see how the list is changed.

After seeing how LINQ revises the list, have a look at each of the methods [here](https://github.com/iomonk/Learn-LINQ/tree/main/Linq/LinqMethods)
